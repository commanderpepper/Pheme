# Pheme
Pheme is an app that displays the news. I made it to understand Compose.

Pheme uses https://newsapi.org/ for the remote source. An API key from NewsAPI is needed to get data from NewsAPI.

Pheme uses the following libraries
- Kotlin
- Compose
- Material 3
- Coroutines / Flows
- RetroFit
- Room
- Hilt
- Moshi
- Mockito

Pheme is made of two screens, an articles list and an article
